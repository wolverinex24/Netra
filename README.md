# Netra: Neural Evaluation for Tomato leaf disease Recognition and pesticides Assistance

## Introduction
Netra is an innovative mobile application developed using Flutter that leverages a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to accurately identify diseases in tomato leaves. Designed to run locally on Android devices, Netra offers farmers and gardeners a quick and reliable way to diagnose plant health.

## Features
- **Local Disease Detection**: Utilizes a YOLOv8 model trained on a specialized dataset for high accuracy.
- **Flutter-Based UI**: A smooth and responsive user interface that's easy to navigate.
- **Offline Capability**: Operates entirely on-device, ensuring functionality without the need for internet access.

## Installation
To install Netra on your Android device, follow these steps:
1. Download the APK from the releases section.
2. Open the APK file on your device and follow the installation prompts.
3. Once installed, open the app and grant the necessary camera permissions.

## Usage
To use Netra for disease detection:
1. Open the app and point your device's camera at a tomato leaf.
2. Tap the 'Scan' button to initiate the detection process.
3. Review the results displayed on the screen for disease identification and information.

## How It Works
Netra uses a YOLOv8 model that has been specially trained to recognize various tomato leaf diseases. When a user scans a leaf, the model processes the image locally and identifies potential diseases based on visual patterns.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to Netra! If you're interested in improving the app or adding new features, please follow these steps:
